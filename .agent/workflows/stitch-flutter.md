# Stitch to Flutter Conversion

Converting: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow Overview

This workflow converts Google Stitch HTML/TailwindCSS designs to production-ready Flutter code.

---

## Phase 1: Design Analysis

1. **Locate Stitch Files**
   - Search for `stitch_*` folders or `*.html` files
   - Verify each folder has `code.html` and `screen.png`
   - List all screens found

2. **Extract Design Tokens** (@stitch-converter-flutter)
   - Parse TailwindCSS config from HTML
   - Extract colors (primary, background, surface)
   - Extract typography (font family, sizes, weights)
   - Extract spacing values
   - Extract border radius values

---

## Phase 2: Code Generation

1. **Generate Theme Files** (@stitch-converter-flutter)
   ```
   lib/theme/
   ├── app_colors.dart
   ├── app_typography.dart
   ├── app_spacing.dart
   └── app_theme.dart
   ```

2. **Generate Screen Widgets** (@stitch-converter-flutter)
   - Parse HTML structure for each screen
   - Convert to Flutter widget tree
   - Apply extracted theme tokens
   - Generate StatelessWidget/StatefulWidget

3. **Generate Reusable Components** (@stitch-converter-flutter)
   - Identify repeated patterns across screens
   - Extract as reusable widgets
   - Generate widget files in `lib/widgets/`

4. **Generate Navigation** (@stitch-converter-flutter)
   - Create navigation structure
   - Setup routes for all screens
   - Generate bottom navigation if present

---

## Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Parallel) ⚡

Run ALL checks **in parallel**:

**1. Accessibility Check** (@a11y-enforcer-flutter)
```
Execute in parallel:
- Validate Semantics on interactive elements
- Check touch targets (48x48)
- Verify contrast ratios
```

**2. Design Token Compliance** (@design-token-guardian-flutter)
```
Execute in parallel:
- Verify all colors use Theme
- Check for hardcoded values
- Validate const usage
```

**3. Performance Check** (@performance-prophet-flutter)
```
Execute in parallel:
- Check widget tree complexity
- Verify const constructors
- Check for unnecessary rebuilds
```

---

## Phase 4: Test Generation

**Generate Tests** (@test-generator-flutter)
- Widget tests for each screen
- Widget tests for reusable components
- Golden tests for visual verification

---

## Output

**Files Generated:**
```
lib/
├── screens/           # From Stitch screens
├── widgets/           # Reusable components
├── theme/             # Extracted tokens
└── navigation/        # App router

test/
├── screens/           # Screen tests
├── widgets/           # Component tests
└── goldens/           # Visual tests
```

**Summary Report:**
- Screens converted: X
- Widgets created: X
- Theme files: 4
- Tests generated: X
- Issues found: X (with fixes)

**Next Steps:**
1. Review generated code
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter test`
4. Connect to state management
5. Replace placeholder data
